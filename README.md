# 🧠 DSA with C

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository built using the **C programming language**. This project is part of my learning journey to strengthen my fundamentals and problem-solving skills in computer science.

## 📌 What You'll Find Here

This repository contains well-structured implementations of classic data structures and algorithms written in C. Each file includes comments and examples for better understanding.

### 🔧 Data Structures
- Arrays
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Stacks
- Queues (Linear & Circular)
- Trees (Binary Trees, BSTs)
- Graphs (Adjacency Matrix/List)

### ⚙️ Algorithms
- Sorting Algorithms: Bubble, Insertion, Selection, Merge, Quick
- Searching Algorithms: Linear Search, Binary Search
- Recursion
- Dynamic Programming (Coming Soon)
- Backtracking (Coming Soon)
- Graph Algorithms: BFS, DFS (Coming Soon)

## 🧪 How to Run

To compile and run any C file:
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
